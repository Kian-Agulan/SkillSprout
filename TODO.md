# Task: Retheme to Hobby Tutoring Website

## Steps to Complete

- [x] src/components/Header.jsx: Update button to "Find Tutor", nav links if needed (e.g., add "Tutors" link).

- [x] src/components/Hero.jsx: Change h1 to "Discover Your Hobby with Expert Tutors", search placeholder to "search for hobbies or tutors", categories to ["Painting", "Guitar Lessons", "Cooking", "Photography", "Yoga"].

- [x] src/components/Cards.jsx: Change h2 to "Popular Hobbies", cards to hobby examples (e.g., "Painting Basics", description, "Enroll Now" button).

- [x] src/components/BottomBar.jsx: Update services to hobby categories (e.g., Arts, Music, Sports, Crafts, Languages, Wellness) with relevant icons.

- [x] src/components/Footer.jsx: Change branding to "HobbyTutorHub", update description to "Learn hobbies with passionate tutors worldwide.".

- [x] src/index.css: Update hero background-image to hobby/tutoring Unsplash (e.g., group learning art), adjust any specific styles if needed (e.g., card text fit).

- [x] Verify changes in code review (syntax, consistency).

- [ ] Run `npm start` to test locally (user may deny; assume manual).

- [ ] Use browser_action for thorough testing: Launch at http://localhost:3000, check hero image/load, search/categories, cards layout/hover, bottom bar icons, footer, responsiveness.

- [ ] Debug issues (e.g., image loading, text overflow in smaller cards).

- [ ] Update TODO.md with retheming completion and mark complete.
